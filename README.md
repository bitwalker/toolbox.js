Toolbox.js
====================

My personal javascript toolbox. No external dependencies, and offers all the utilities you need to write clean and modular application code. 

It is a work in progress, but should at least be worth a look for individual functions. Once this reaches some kind of stable release, I'll update this
site with documentation, and additional info as far as bugs, roadmap, etc.
