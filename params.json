{"name":"Toolbox.js","tagline":"A general purpose javascript utility library. Contains everything you need, and most anything worth having (other than DOM manipulation).","body":"## Why Toolkit.js?\r\nFair question. I've been a fond user of Underscore.js, as well as underscore.string, for quite some time. I found Underscore generally lacking in the functional programming tools department, which is what I initially started putting this library together for. I figured that I'd rather have one dependency that fulfills my needs than two, so I also re-implemented the collections functions that I used Underscore for. Over time this evolved into adding little utility functions that I thought would likely be needed again, and the toolkit was born.\r\n\r\nI also wanted this to be reusable across platforms (Node.js, the browser), as well as allow for the use of module loaders like require.js (hence the AMD module compatibility). It is an additional goal to keep the minified version of this project as small as possible, while still providing as much utility as possible. I build new functions by reusing existing components where possible, and in that way I hope to save on file size, as well as keep thing maintainable in the long run.\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\n\r\nYou can either add a `<script>` tag to your page, or `require` it in Node. The un-minified source is well commented, but if it's more readable, the full html documentation is available in the `/docs` directory of the repository.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently, I'm (@bitwalker) the sole author and contributor. I'm hoping that more people will join me in making this the ideal javascript utility library!\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nCreate a new support ticket [here](https://github.com/bitwalker/toolbox.js/issues). I should be able to respond within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
